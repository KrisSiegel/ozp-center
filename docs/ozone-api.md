##Ozone API
The new Ozone API has two main components: a server-side and a client-side version. Both versions utilize a majority of the same source code with exceptions depending on the environment.

###Files
The following files are created upon build with their respective usage:

```./ozone-modules/ozone-api/server-api.js``` -> This file should be included in the node.js side for server-side usage

```./ozone-modules/ozone-api/client-api.js``` -> This file should be included in frontend projects for client-side usage. This file is fully expanded for debugging purposes.

```./ozone-modules/ozone-api/client-api.min.js``` -> This file is the same as the client-api.js except it is minified and expected to be used in production like environments.

###API Documentation
The API documentation is fully generated by yuidoc. To get the current API run ```grunt build``` or ```grunt yuidoc``` then browse to ```./docs/code/index.html``` to view all documentation.
